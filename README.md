# Popular NFT Projects Contracts
None of this is my own work, it's rather a place to collate NFT contracts from popular projects.

Right now all of this is available on Etherscan but hard to browse and save for later. Ultimately the goal for storing it here is to make it easier for devs to learn from what has come before them.

## Projects List
- [CoolCats](https://www.coolcatsnft.com/)
- [Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC)](https://boredapeyachtclub.com/)

## Possible Improvements
- **Commentary**: I'd like to add some commentary to each contract to explain things such as on-chain or off-chain or delayed release etc. 
- **Runnable**: It would be fairly easy to make each one locally runnable using hardhat. Then it'd be a lot easier to play with each contract.

If anyone wants to do these by submitting PRs then go for it.

## How to Contribute
Feel free to submit PRs with new contracts, try and either ensure that it is either a well known project OR is an example of doing something differently. If you didn't know, you can find all the code on Etherscan (e.g. [here](https://etherscan.io/contractsVerified))

When you submit a new contract make sure you create a new folder and also add it to the Projects list in this README.
